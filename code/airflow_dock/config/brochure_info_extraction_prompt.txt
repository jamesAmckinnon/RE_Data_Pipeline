    If a value is not explicitly mentioned, return 'N/A'. The output should be structured as JSON.\n\n
    Do not, under any circumstances, infer values by calculation or estimation, only include values that exist in the document and that you are confident of. Marking a value as 'N/A' is better than being wrong.\n 
    Only output the json content, no other messages are needed.\n
    Dollar values should have dollar signs next to them to be included, SF measurements should have SF units to be included.\n
    
    Extract the following details from the attached commercial real estate PDF and return JSON-formatted results:\n

    If the pdf has details on more than one property (e.g. a portfolio), extract the details for each property separately. 
    An output with multiple properties should be structured in the following format: [{...}, {...}, ...] whereas a single 
    property should be structured as {...}.
